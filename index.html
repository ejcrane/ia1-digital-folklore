            <h3>hi there!</h3>
            <p>
                my name is ethan and thank you for visiting my homepage!
                here you can find my interests, what i've been doing recently,
                some personal philosophy, and of course my socials.
            </p>

                    we're creating the web, putting whatever we want and
                    saying whatever we want. we're borrowing from this
                    early ethos of expressing ourselves.
                </h3>
                <p>
                    the website is a powerful and unwieldy thing. 
                    you can say anything you want in the exact way you 
                    want to, but doing so takes time and effort. back
                    when the internet was a veritable wilderness, cutting
                    through wires and forging one's own path was the only
                    way to make a website, and these paths had their own
                    intricacies that made each website admittedly not that
                    great, but unique nonetheless.
                </p>
                <p>
                    nowadays, the easiest paths to proclaimed self-expression
                    are six-lane superhighways, fresh asphalt poured by a
                    big few companies, namely meta, google, amazon, and others.
                    it is far easier to set up a profile on instagram than to 
                    make and host your own website. but these roads have speed
                    limits, they have rules; these roads have terms and conditions
                    that bound user expression. the roads have different names and
                    different colors, yet they all feel the same. tyranny of the
                    majority dictated what was considered universally appealing, and
                    appealed to the masses the corporations did.
                </p>
                <p>
                    the cost? self-expression. <span><marquee>INDIVIDUALITY!</marquee></span> the profiles may have
                    different photos, but they all feel the same. this is why i prefer
                    the website to the profile.

                <h3>what i've been up to recently 11/24/23</h3>
                <p>
                    in my spare time, i've been picking up the guitar quite a bit.
                    i started learning back in july, and i like to think i've improved
                    significantly. here are a few songs i really enjoy playing:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>the place where he inserted the blade - black country, new road</li>
                    <li>karma police - radiohead</li>
                    <li>stop me if you think you've heard this one before - the smiths</li>
                    <li>basket case - green day</li>
                    <li>big rock candy mountain - harry mcclintock (i love the burl ives one too)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>you can see me play some of these songs <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jaymbes_guitar/" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

                <h3>here's a few websites i think are neat</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href="http://www.themostamazingwebsiteontheinternet.com/" target="_blank">www.themostamazingwebsiteontheinternet.com</a>
                        <br>possibly the most egregious use of hypertext hijinks
                        i've ever seen, there isn't a single thing about this
                        website i'd change. i first discovered it from
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh0bczrw4NU" target="_blank">vinesauce joel</a>
                        over seven years ago. don't forget to play the music!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://theuselessweb.com/" target="_blank">https://theuselessweb.com/</a>
                        <br> useless? debatable. entertaining? certainly.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://www.thatsyourjam.com/" target="_blank">https://www.thatsyourjam.com/</a>
                        <br> i spent a lot of time playing this in robotics class.
                        don't tell mr. deloach (i think he knew)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="">google</a>
                        <br> just kidding use duckduckgo or ecosia
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>
                this page was made for my internet art class! i tried
                to make this a little more personal and goofy than
                something like a professional portfolio, making this
                into a more nostalgic, expressive, and warm format.
                i hope you liked it!
            </p>
